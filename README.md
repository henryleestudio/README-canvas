# React Modern Vision
React Application - Front end

The Artwear Catalog is an art / fashion exhibition for one of a kind, hand painted, art to wear pieces. It showcases the co-creative talents of models, photographers, designers, and artists in the creative-professional community in Philadelphia, and has a custom art to wear interface that enables the user to create their own art to wear.

## Design
This design concept is inspired by the high fashion catalog aesthetic, so I decided to design a clean and spacious style layout with dynamic typographic, in relation to the catalog style photography to embody a modern art gallery look and feel. All art pieces are made by yours truly or in collaboration with another artist. I was intentional about not using a template for this project. Graphic design work is done by scratch.
